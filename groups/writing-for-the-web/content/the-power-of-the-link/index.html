<p>
	Linking is a powerful gesture. And there are several ways to use links in a blog post. Some ways links are used (certainly not limited to this list):</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		As evidence for your point </li>
	<li>
		A recommending for that post</li>
	<li>
		An attribution for someone else's idea</li>
	<li>
		A way to engage the original author</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<br>
	Usually they are some combination of the above. Where you place links <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2008/10/importance-of-link-architecture.html">can be important</a>.  However, links <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2010/05/experiments_in.php">can also be </a><a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2010/05/experiments_in.php">distracting</a>, so you'll need to make a decision about how much you link.</p>
<h1>
	Write </h1>
<p>
	<span style="background-color: transparent;">Draft a new blog post (without links). As a second step, go back and revise it to include several links to the information you reference. </span></p>
<h1>
	Post</h1>
<p>
	<span style="background-color: transparent;">Post that URL to this P2PU task along with your answers to the following questions.</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="background-color: transparent;">How are the non-linked and linked versions of your post different?</span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="background-color: transparent;">What do you let the link say for you? </span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="background-color: transparent;">What message does linking send to the reader? </span></li>
</ul></div>
