	Let's get to it.</p>
<h1>
	Recall Your Reading History</h1>
<p>
	<em>Back in the day, what was your favorite outlet to read in print</em>? Which print publications did you subscribe to, or seek out on a regular basis?</p>
<p>
	<em>Is there a moment when you started reading that publication online, or only online? </em>Do you remember that moment of transition? What was it like?</p>
<p>
	What do you expect from that online experience that's not there in the print version? What does the online version offer you that the print version doesn't?</p>
